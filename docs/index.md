# DigiLut Data Challenge (2024)

**This project is my submission to the DigiLut competition.**

The [**DigiLut challenge**](https://app.trustii.io/datasets/1526), a collaborative project between Trustii.io and Foch Hospital and supported by the Health Data Hub and Bpifrance, aims to develop a medical decision support algorithm to diagnose graft rejection episodes in lung transplant patients by detecting pathological regions (A lesions) on transbronchial biopsies.
