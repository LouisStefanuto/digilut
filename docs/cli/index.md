# CLI

This package leverages [**Typer**](https://typer.tiangolo.com) to create a Command Line Interface (CLI). Typer is a library that simplifies the creation of CLI applications by using Python 3.6+ type hints. It provides an intuitive and powerful way to define commands, arguments, and options. It is a more concise alternative to `argparse`.

The CLI is the recommended way to interact with the main python scripts of the repo.
